# Lab 04: Graphical User Interfaces
CSC 210 – Computer Programming 2  
Student: Danna Gomez  
Semester: Fall 2025  
Professor: Conroy

## Objective
This lab introduces Java Swing. The goal is to build GUI programs that:
- Use buttons, labels, text fields, text areas, and lists
- React to user events (button clicks, list selection)
- Work with collections of data (ArrayList of Creature objects)
- Load and save Creature data to a file

## Program 1 – HelloGUI.java
A simple window with:
- A blank label
- A button labeled "Greet"
When the button is clicked, the program randomly chooses one of 5 greetings and shows it in the label.

How to compile/run:
```bash
javac HelloGUI.java
java HelloGUI
