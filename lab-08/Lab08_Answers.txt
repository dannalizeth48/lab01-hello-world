4) CircleSizeSlider
a) The circle size is updated by the method that sets the diameter on the drawing component (the panel’s setter for the circle diameter).
b) The circle is redrawn whenever the slider change listener fires and requests a repaint; Swing then redraws by calling the component’s paint routine.

5) Random Programs (RandomHexPrinter / RawRandomHexStreamer)
a) They get random bytes by making an HTTP request to Random.org and reading the response bytes.
b) Random.org is intended to be “true” random (physical noise source), not a deterministic pseudo‑random algorithm like java.util.Random.

6) LogisticMapGenerator (x_{n+1} = r*x_n*(1 - x_n))
a) Extinction: 0 < r < 1 (the population converges to 0).
b) Converges to a constant (stable fixed point): 1 < r < 3.
c) Oscillating / chaotic: r > 3 (period‑doubling roughly 3 to ~3.57; mostly chaotic beyond ~3.57 up to 4, with periodic windows).

10) Agentic Simulation (RabbitAgentSimulationEmergent)
a) The rabbit population limit is set by resource limits (food/carrots) plus the program’s survival/reproduction rules, which create a carrying‑capacity effect.
b) The carrot population is maintained by the program’s carrot growth/respawn rules each turn (new carrots appear according to the code’s parameters).
c) The simulation should qualitatively match the logistic map (stable → oscillating → chaotic as growth increases), but it can differ because it is discrete, rule‑based, and sensitive to randomness and resource timing.
